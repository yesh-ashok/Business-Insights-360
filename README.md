# Business Insights 360

## Project Overview

AtliQ Hardware has experienced rapid growth in recent years and, to maintain their competitive edge and facilitate data-driven decision-making, they have decided to implement data analytics using Power BI. This initiative aims to provide stakeholders with comprehensive insights across various aspects of the business, including finance, sales, marketing, and supply chain management.

This project was a part of the codebasics PowerBI course, Link to the course is [here](https://codebasics.io/bootcamps/dashboard/data-analytics-bootcamp-with-practical-job-assistance).

## Project Approach

### Questions to Ask Before Starting the Project

#### Business Objectives:
- What are the primary goals of this Power BI implementation?
- Which business areas (finance, sales, marketing, supply chain) need the most attention?

#### Stakeholder Requirements:
- Who are the key stakeholders, and what specific insights do they need?
- Are there any existing pain points or data challenges that need addressing?

#### Data Sources:
- What data sources will be used, and how will data be integrated?
- Are there any data quality issues that need to be resolved beforehand?

#### Data Security and Compliance:
- What are the data security and compliance requirements?
- Who will have access to the reports and dashboards?

#### Technical Specifications:
- What are the technical requirements for the implementation?
- What is the current IT infrastructure, and how will Power BI fit into it?

#### Training and Support:
- What training will be provided to users?
- What support structures are in place for ongoing maintenance and troubleshooting?

### Key Steps in the Project

#### Data Preparation and Modeling
- Creating Calculated Columns: Define new data columns using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for enhanced analysis.
- Creating Measures Using DAX Language: Develop complex calculations to summarize and analyze data effectively.
- Data Modeling: Establish relationships between different data tables to create a coherent data model.
- Creating Date Table Using M Language: Generate a date table to support time-based data analysis.

#### Visualizations and Interactivity
- Using Bookmarks to Switch Between Two Visuals: Implement bookmarks to allow users to toggle between different visual states seamlessly.
- Page Navigation with Buttons: Create interactive buttons for easy navigation between different report pages.
- Dynamic Titles Based on Applied Filters: Use DAX to create titles that change dynamically according to the filters applied.
- Using KPI Indicators: Implement Key Performance Indicators to monitor critical metrics.
- Conditional Formatting: Apply conditional formatting to highlight important values in visuals using icons or background colors.

#### Data Validation and Quality
- Data Validation Techniques: Ensure the accuracy and integrity of data through various validation methods.
- Using Divide Function to Prevent Zero Division Errors: Utilize the DIVIDE function in DAX to handle division operations safely.

#### Deployment and Maintenance
- Power BI Services: Use Power BI services to deploy and share reports.
- Publishing Reports to Power BI Services: Publish the developed reports to the Power BI service for broader access.
- Setting Up Personal Gateway for Auto-Refresh: Configure a personal gateway to enable automatic data refresh.
- Power BI App Creation: Develop a Power BI app for easier report distribution and access.
- Collaboration, Workspace, Access Permissions in Power BI Services: Manage collaboration and access permissions within Power BI workspaces.

#### Additional Considerations
- Regularly update and maintain the reports to ensure they remain relevant and accurate.
- Continuously gather feedback from stakeholders to refine and improve the reports and dashboards.

By addressing these areas, AtliQ Hardware can ensure a successful implementation of Power BI, providing valuable insights and supporting data-driven decision-making across the organization.
